CONCEPT:[]
- Idea was to have a web application act as a portal to Revolut API for my personal account. 
-- Within Revolut app, you can set specific transactions against a category defined by you.
-- The web application would call the Revolut API when the app is opened, getting all the latest data/transactions against my account.
-- This would also be provided with the defined category set against the transaction (if there is one set)
-- If there would be no category automatically assigned (i.e. new merchant) you could set this category within the web app. 

- Outside of the Revolut portal aspect, you can create a budget using a calculator, based on salary, expenses and budgetting against certain categories.
-- This aspect wouldn't be fed into Revolut, more of an interface for your budgetting needs. 

Looking at the API provided by Revolut, it appears to be very restrictive... Only would apply if you have a business account. 
Even if they do provide access for a personal account, the transaction only provide limited data, no data against category based on the JSON response.
